## Introduction

Hello,

My name is Benjamin Li and I'm currently a 12th grade student at [Bloor Collegiate Institute](http://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/bloorci/). I enjoy gaming, playing guitar, and coding in my spare time.

### Resume

Included here is [my resume](https://github.com/BenjaminBLi/BenjaminBLi.github.io/blob/master/ResumeFinal.pdf).

### Guitar

I'm a classically-trained guitarist, and have been playing since the 3rd grade. I've earned an [RCM Provincial Gold Medal](https://www.mississaugaschoolofmusic.ca/awards) for the level 2 examination, and placed as an honourable mention in the OMFA Grade 10 Classical guitar competition. 

### Coding

The large majority of my programming experience has been participating in competitive programming, and my results can be seen in the [competitive programming repo](https://github.com/BenjaminBLi/ccc-with-c) I regularly update. I've also posted an [email server backend](https://github.com/BenjaminBLi/IcsEmailServer) my 12th grade ICS class has been maintaining, and the results of a TDSB-organized software development competition, which [I created in 4 hours](https://github.com/BenjaminBLi/ShsmTdsb)
