                    Guitar as been my passion since I was 8. I began my journey as a classical guitarist, and continued my path until I earned
                    a 4th place in the provincial OMFA Competition for Grade 10 classical guitar. I was pitted against 14 other guitarists,
                    many of whom were planning or majoring in classical guitar in university. I then went on to to train as a jazz guitarist with
                    <a href="http://robcampbellguitar.com/">Rob Campbell</a> for a few years. You can find some samples of my performances
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-oHbHB4Wsw">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-oHbHB4Wsw"> here </a>.

                    I picked up breakdance once I arrived at UWaterloo in my 1A term and immediately fell in love with it. I joined the UW Breakers
                    club and have began documenting some of my progress on
